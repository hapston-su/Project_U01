# | `PlayerController.cs` | Handles player movement and shooting. |

# | `Projectile.cs` | Controls shell speed, lifetime, and collisions. |

# | `EnemyFollow.cs` | Makes enemies move toward the player. |

# | `DetectCollisions.cs` | Detects collisions and triggers explosions or game over. |

# | `DeleteAfterExplosion.cs` | Delete the spawn Particle System prefabs for creating explosion effect and sound. |

# | `DifficultyLevel.cs` | Controls the UI slider and the game difficulty levels (speed of the enemy, number of enemy tanks ). |
